# DASH-CAM: Dynamic Approximate SearcH Content Addressable Memory for genome classification

---

## Description

The **DASH-CAM** is a versatile tool designed to simulate dynamic storage-based approximate search content addressable memory (DASH-CAM) for computational genomics applications,
particularly for the identification and classification of viral pathogens of epidemic significance. It provides insights into the hardware's behavior under various conditions and aids in testing and verification before deployment in real-world scenarios.
